    "**Anticipated challenges:** We expect that the fitting of the data into our attributes is going to be a bit tricky, in that using effective field goal percentage and scoring margin are all going to be compiled stats using multiple sources. We also anticipate a good bit of trouble in the discretization of data, and are using plenty of normalization tactics to achieve this. For our scoring margin we're considering using a normal distributive formula to get normalized data.\n",
